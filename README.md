# Instaclone 

### What is it about?
Instaclone is a web application where users can share their pictures, like them and write comments. It is made by the idea of Instagram implementing few of the most popular functionalities. I was made as a part of my learning process of Node.js and React. The focus was on the backend implementing the API endpoints and the communication with the database. The frontend components and the design will be upgraded in future.

### How it is made?
Picturo is developed as MERN stack app where it uses nodejs (REST) to serve the backend part and reactjs for the frontend. It includes authentication and validation on both ends. All components are custom, stylized using modern CSS techniques.

### Is the app deployed?
You can check the first version of the app here: https://insta-clone-project.herokuapp.com/ and test their functionalities.
